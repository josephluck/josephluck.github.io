Whilst there are many to list, I am particularly experienced with functional programming in TypeScript using libraries such as React, Redux, Ramda and Jest. I also have experience with CoffeeScript, ES6/7 and NodeJS as well as other popular MVC libraries such as Vue, Angular and Backbone.

I lead Fantastec&#39;s front-end team and liaise with the wider product team and stakeholders to build several products. During Fanstastec&#39;s early stages I have a large part to play in the UI and UX of several products and I have been fortunate enough to establish several best practises such as style-guides, atomic design, functional / typesafe programming and component-based architecture. During my first month, I lead a migration away from a proprietary framework that severely hindered productivity to a modern stack consisting of Typescript, Styled Components, Next and React.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph"><span class="b" data-type="strong">Goodlord</span> <span class="i" data-type="em">Software Engineer - November 2016 to April 2018</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph">Goodlord is a property technology company, primarily serving estate agents and tenants in the UK. I worked at Goodlord during a period of high growth both commercially and internally. I saw the core engineering team grow from a mere 6 to over 20 strong and during that period, I was involved and helped build features for several projects both customer-facing and internal. Whilst at Goodlord, I helped design and engineer a framework built around React called Helix and introduced the team to modern front-end techniques such as component-driven design and unidirectional data flow.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph"><span class="b" data-type="strong">Commusoft</span> <span class="i" data-type="em">Senior front-end engineer - March 2016 to November 2016</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph">Commusoft is a large customer relationship management system catered for the service industry.

During this time, I also mentored a junior front-end engineer and implemented modern software engineering / agile practises such as kanban, pair programming, code review and git-flow.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph"><span class="b" data-type="strong">Commusoft</span> <span class="i" data-type="em">Junior front-end developer - July 2014 - March 2016</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-type="paragraph">I started my software engineering career at Commusoft where I quickly became autonomous under the direction of a senior front-end engineer.
