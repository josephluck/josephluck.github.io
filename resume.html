I&#39;m also a passionate contributor to open source having published libraries through <a href="https://github.com/josephluck" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~josephluck" title="Npm">Npm</a>.</p><div class="mv4 bb b--black-10"></div><h2 class="normal f3 lh-copy mv3">Skills</h2><p class="lh-copy mv3">I have commercial experience in a wide range of front-end tools and libraries. Whilst there are many to list, I am particularly experienced with functional programming in TypeScript using libraries such as React, Redux, Ramda and Jest. I also have experience with CoffeeScript, ES6/7 and NodeJS as well as other popular MVC libraries such as Vue, Angular and Backbone. Aside from my technical skills, I&#39;m a keen visual and user-experience designer and I pride myself on being an excellent problem solver, meticulously solving complex business problems.</p><div class="mv4 bb b--black-10"></div><h2 class="normal f3 lh-copy mv3">Experience</h2><p class="lh-copy mv3"><span class="b">Fantastec</span> <span class="i">Front End Lead - April 2018 to Present</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3">Working in a small, focussed engineering team, I head up Fantastec&#39;s front-end team.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3"><span class="b">Goodlord</span> <span class="i">Software Engineer - November 2016 to April 2018</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3">Goodlord is a property technology company, primarily serving estate agents and tenants in the UK. I worked at Goodlord during a period of high growth both comercially and internally. I saw the core engineering team grow from a mere 6 to over 20 strong and during that period, I was involved and helped build features for several projects both customer-facing and internal. Whilst at Goodlord, I helped design and engineer a framework built around React called Helix and introduced the team to modern front-end techniques such as component-driven design and unidirectional data flow.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3"><span class="b">Commusoft</span> <span class="i">Senior front-end engineer - March 2016 to November 2016</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3">Commusoft is a large customer relationship management system catered for the service industry. I lead Commusoft&#39;s small front-end team for 8 months where I had a lead role in product and design as well as developing the front-end for the customer facing and internal products using a mixture of technologies such as Angular, React and Backbone. During this time, I also mentored a junior front-end engineer and implemented modern software engineering / agile practises such as kanban, pair programming, code review and git-flow.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3"><span class="b">Commusoft</span> <span class="i">Junior front-end developer - July 2014 - March 2016</span></p><p class="lh-copy mv3">I started my software engineering career at Commusoft where I quickly became autonomous under the direction of a senior front-end engineer. I was responsible for core feature development and design of a large CRM platform spanning multiple products. Towards the end of my position, I was single-handedly responsible for a customer facing product that I engineered using React and liased with an off-shore backend team to see the product through to production.</p><div class="mv4 bb b--black-10"></div><h2 class="normal f3 lh-copy mv3">Open Source</h2><p class="lh-copy mv3">I&#39;m always developing my skills and often publish my work on <a href="https://github.com/josephluck" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://npmjs.com/~josephluck" title="Npm">Npm</a>.
