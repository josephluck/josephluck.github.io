# Building a functional programming library for fun: Part 1

I'm sad to admit that I have a love for functional programming. Yes, it's sad. But what's even more sad (to sad ol' me) is that my favorite JavaScript functional programming library, space-lift has been removed from GitHub! ðŸ˜¢

So what else is there to do other than to build my very own functional programming library? I mean.. How hard can it really be? Everyone knows what a _monad_ is, right?

## I know nothing

Okay, so I don't _really_ know what a monad is, even though I tout all the time to my colleagues that functional programming is great for a number of reasons. It's about time that I learn the fundamentals of abstract data types, and what better way is there to do that than to build a library that implements them?

## What's next?

In this blog series, I'll be documenting my way through building up a functional programming library from scratch in TypeScript along with trying my best to explain the data types as I learn and implement them.

Stay tuned (if you're sad like me)!
