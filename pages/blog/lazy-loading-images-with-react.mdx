# Lazy loading images with React

In this post we will be exploring a technique for lazy loading images in React that makes use of the [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) browser API.

The end goal is to build a drop-in replacement for the `<img />` tag that defers loading the actual image file until it's needed.

#### TLDR?

If you prefer to jump straight in to the code, you can visit the [final implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck/afterimage).

## Why?

Defering the load of off-screen images can [significantly improve page performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/), and since there's little to no detriment to the user experience, there's really no reason not to.
