# Creating a Next.js mono repository project with TypeScript

In this post, we'll be exploring how to set up a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) mono repository project taking advantage of both [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We'll set up a project from scratch, consisting of an application package, an API workspace and a shared component library package. After all of that, we'll add Storybook and discuss deployment strategies.

The goal of all of this is to be able to make source file changes in one workspace that instant hot-reloads our Next.js project without having to run any manual build tasks, pull from npm, github or otherwise.

This post assumes you're already familiar with npm, TypeScript, Next.js and React. It's lengthy, so grab a coffee and a fresh terminal.

## Some explanations

#### Why a mono repository?

A mono repository project structure is a popular choice for projects that benefit from sharing code such as open-source projects that publish many libraries from the same codebase such as [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) or products that have many deployable applications like [Spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) does.

#### Next.js

This post focusses specifically on Next.js since it's a popular opinionated framework that provides a simple tool and runtime over the complicated developer tooling necessary to create modern front-end applications.

However, since Next.js is opinionated, it can be tricky pairing it with other libraries and project-specific configuration, and it's even more difficult to use within a mono repository set up.

#### TypeScript

Although certainly not a requirement for mono repository projects, TypeScript is a great tool and there are some specific configurations needed to get TypeScript to work well with a mono repository and Next.js.

---

## Setting things up

We'll be using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as our dependency management tool and task runner. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using npm:

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

> You may need to use `sudo` if you get a permission error

Go ahead and create a new directory for the mono repository:

```bash
mkdir acme
cd acme
```

Initialize the mono repository with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn init
```

Accept the default options and open up the project in your favorite text editor.

#### Enabling workspaces

Yarn requires `"private"` to be set to `true` in `/package.json`, you can read more about why [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/#toc-how-to-use-it). Let's go ahead and make that change:

```json
{
  ...
  "private": true
  ...
}
```

---

## Creating our first workspace

We'll begin by setting up our main application, a simple blog website:

```bash
mkdir blog
cd blog
yarn init
```

When yarn prompts, accept the default options again and open up the `/blog/package.json` file that has been created, we'll need to change it's `"name"` property to enable it to be used in our mono repository:

```json
{
  ...
  "name": "@acme/blog"
  ...
}
```

We've changed the `"name"` property to `"@acme/blog"` where `@acme` refers to the package's [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes). We'll use `@acme` as the scope for all of workspaces in this project.

#### Telling yarn that we've got a workspace

Yarn will read the `"workspaces"` key in the top-level `/package.json` file in your project to lookup workspaces. Let's go ahead and add our new workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "workspaces": ["blog"]
  ...
}
```

> ⚠️ We tell yarn where to find our workspace in the directory structure rather than what the workspace "name" is.

We'll pick up workspaces again in a bit.

---

## Building our blog application

We're ready to build out our blog application. Make sure your current working directory is `blog` and add the following dependencies:

```bash
yarn add next
yarn add react
yarn add react-dom
yarn add @zeit/next-typescript
yarn add typescript
yarn add @types/next
yarn add @types/react
yarn add @types/react-dom
```

> ⚠️ Once these have finished, yarn will create a `yarn.lock` file at the root of the repository. If this hasn't happened, or the `yarn.lock` file is somewhere else in the directory structure, something has gone wrong!

#### Setting up development scripts

Let's add a couple of scripts to `/blog/package.json` to allow us to develop the application:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build"
  }
  ...
}
```

> If you run `yarn dev` now you'll see the error "Couldn't find a `pages` directory. Please create one under the project root".

#### Creating our first page

Next's router will serve the default exported React component in `/pages/index` when visiting the application's `/` route. Create and write the following to `/blog/pages/index.tsx`:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { NextStatelessComponent } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";

interface Props {
  posts: any[];
}

const BlogIndex: NextStatelessComponent<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Acme's blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link passHref href={`/${post.id}`}>
              <a>{post.title}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

BlogIndex.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const posts = [
    { id: 1, title: "10 great drinking games" },
    { id: 2, title: "3 amazing hangover antidotes!" }
  ];
  return { posts };
};

export default BlogIndex;
```

> For now, we've used hard-coded data and simple HTML elements for the design. However, we'll replace these when we build our API and shared component library later.

Go ahead and run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

😕 We've got a `404` but we were expecting our post listing... What's up?

## TypeScript, babel, next, oh my!

So Next.js has an issue picking up the `index.tsx` file we just made. Clearly there's some work to be done.

#### Configuring TypeScript

We've already installed `TypeScript` in our `blog` workspace, but we haven't created a `tsconfig.json` file yet. We'll be writing our other workspaces in TypeScript as well and it would be nice to share a base configuration so let's create a root level `/tsconfig.json` with the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "esnext"
  }
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration will be shared between all of our workspaces.

Now we can extend it in `/blog/tsconfig.json` workspace:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "lib": ["dom", "es2017"]
  }
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration will inherit the base configuration and add specific configuration for our blog project.

#### Transpiling via babel

We need to create a `/babel.config.js` file to instruct `babel` to transpile TypeScript files for us.

Make a `babel.config.js` file at the root of the repository so that it is shared between our `blog` workspace and the other workspaces we'll be making later in the post:

```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);

  const presets = [
    "next/babel",
    ["@babel/preset-typescript", { isTSX: true, allExtensions: true }]
  ];

  const plugins = [];

  return {
    presets,
    plugins
  };
};
```

> You can read more about the `babel.config.js` file [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration#what-s-your-use-case).

#### Letting Next.js know what we've done

Lastly, let's tie everything together via `/blog/next.config.js`:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const withTypeScript = require("@zeit/next-typescript");
const withCustomBabelConfigFile = require("next-plugin-custom-babel-config");

module.exports = withCustomBabelConfigFile(
  withTypeScript({
    babelConfigFile: path.resolve("../babel.config.js")
  })
);
```

You'll notice a new dependency `next-plugin-custom-babel-config`, ensure you're in the `blog` directory and install it:

```bash
yarn add next-plugin-custom-babel-config
```

This plugin is required to [monkey patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) `next-babel-loader` to use our shared `babel.config.js` file.

#### And...

First milestone done and dusted! 🎉🎉🎉

yarn dev
```

## On to the API workspace

We've successfully set up a simple Next.js application workspace that uses a shared `babel.config.js` and inherits a shared `tsconfig.json` file, but we've hard-coded the list of posts. Let's fix that by creating a simple API to serve us a list of blog posts.

#### Setting up the workspace

We've been here before, but for completeness ensure your current working directory is the root of the project and run the following:

```bash
mkdir api
cd api
yarn init
```

Again, accept the defaults and modify the generated `/api/package.json` to rename the package:

```json
{
  ...
  "name": "@acme/api"
  ...
}
```

Lastly, update the root `/package.json` to reflect our new workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "workspaces": [
    "blog",
    "api"
  ]
  ...
}
```

#### Installing dependencies we'll need

It's outside the scope of this post to create a fully-fledged back-end for a blog website, so for brevity, we'll simulate it using a combination of [`faker.js`](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) and [`express`](https://github.com/expressjs/express). Ensure your current working directory is `api` and run the following:

```bash
yarn add faker
yarn add express
yarn add typescript
yarn add ts-node
yarn add @types/faker
yarn add @types/express
```

#### Adding TypeScript

Similar to the blog workspace, add TypeScript configuration to our API workspace via `/api/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
```

> Note that we set `"module"` to `"commonjs"` for `ts-node`

#### Creating the API

We'll only need a single `index.ts` file for our simple fake API. Write the following to `/api/index.ts`:

```typescript
import * as express from "express";
import * as faker from "faker";

export namespace Models {
  export interface Post {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    content: string;
  }
}

function randomPost(): Models.Post {
  return {
    id: faker.random.uuid(),
    title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
    content: faker.lorem.paragraphs()
  };
}

const app = express();

app.get("/posts", (_req, res) => {
  const posts: Models.Post[] = Array.from({ length: 10 }).map(randomPost);
  res.json(posts);
});

app.listen(5000);

console.log("API started on port 5000");
```

> Note that we export the `Models` namespace. We'll use this namespace in the `blog` workspace later

#### Setting up scripts

Lastly we'll create a script in `/api/package.json` to start the API:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node ./index.ts"
  },
  ...
}
```

Go ahead and run the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000/posts](http://localhost:5000/posts).

#### API client library

In order to keep the interface between the blog application and the API consistent, we'll create a simple API client library implemented in TypeScript that the blog application can import and use to make requests to the API.

Firstly, add `axios` to the `api` workspace:

```bash
yarn add axios
```

Create `/api/client.ts` and write the following to it:

```typescript
import axios from "axios";
import { Models } from ".";

const baseURL = "http://localhost:5000";

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL
});

export const apiClient = {
  posts: {
    async getListing(): Promise<Models.Post[]> {
      const { data } = await instance.get("/posts");
      return data;
    }
  }
};
```

---

## Back to the blog app

Now that the API is finished, let's update the blog to use the API client we just made.

Since this is the first time we've used a workspace within another workspace, we need to make a small adjustment to the `/blog/package.json` file to tell yarn that we wish to use the API workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@acme/api": "*"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Now that's out of the way, open up `/blog/index.tsx` and make the following adjustments:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { NextStatelessComponent } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Models } from "@acme/api";
import { apiClient } from "@acme/api/client";

interface Props {
  posts: Models.Post[];
}

const BlogIndex: NextStatelessComponent<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Acme's blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link passHref href={`/${post.id}`}>
              <a>{post.title}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

BlogIndex.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const posts = await apiClient.posts.getListing();
  return { posts };
};

export default BlogIndex;
```

Keep the API running in one terminal, and open up another in the `/blog` directory and run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to inspect our API-driven blog.

😕 We've got another error... What's up now!?

## Workspace transpilation

Right now, we've set up Babel to transpile the TypeScript in our workspaces, but by default, it ignores modules in `node_modules`, however, we need to transpile the workspaces that are used as dependencies in other workspaces (and they reside as symlinks in `node_modules`).

Luckily for us, there's another Next.js plugin we can use called [`next-plugin-transpile-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-plugin-transpile-modules). Let's add it from the `/blog` directory:

```bash
yarn add next-plugin-transpile-modules
```

Update `/blog/next.config.js` to use the plugin:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const withTypescript = require("@zeit/next-typescript");
const withCustomBabelConfigFile = require("next-plugin-custom-babel-config");
const withTM = require("next-plugin-transpile-modules");

module.exports = withCustomBabelConfigFile(
  withTM(
    withTypescript({
      babelConfigFile: path.resolve("../babel.config.js"),
      transpileModules: ["@acme"]
    })
  )
);
```

The `transpileModules` key is set to `["@acme"]` which instructs Babel to transpile any modules with the scope `@acme`. This is great because it means that if we add any other workspaces, we only need to add them to `package.json` to be able to use them right away.

#### And...

Another milestone covered! 🎉🎉🎉
