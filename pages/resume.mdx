## Skills

I'm a front-end specialist having spent the last 5 years working in tight-nit teams as a front-end software engineer and designer. I am particularly experienced building web-based products in TypeScript using frameworks and libraries such as React, React Native, Next, Redux, Ramda and Jest. More recently, I have been exposed to back-end development with technologies such as Node.js, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 amongst others. Aside from my technical skills, I'm a keen user interface and user experience designer.

## Experience

**Fantastec Technology** _Front-end lead - April 2018 to Present_

Fantastec is a sports technology start-up dedicated to helping sports fans engage with their favourite sports, teams, and players. I lead Fantastec's front-end team and liaise with the wider product team and stakeholders to build several web and native products.

During my time at Fantastec, I have been instrumental in defining core front-end architecture around React, React Native and Typescript. As a lead, I also have a large part to play in the design and direction of several core products and have been fortunate enough to work closely alongside the product lead in defining a robust product roadmap. Working alongside Fantastec's CTO and wider engineering team, I have been able to take the product roadmap and turn it into practical deliverables through considered architectural decisions.

Aside from the bigger picture product, architectural and managerial responsibilities at Fantastec, I also build feature work and manage a team of 4 front-end software engineers. During my time at Fantastec, I picked up and became fully autonomous in a large React Native codebase and helped mentor and onboard junior members of the team to React Native.

**Goodlord** _Senior software engineer - November 2016 to April 2018_

Goodlord is a property technology company building a software platform for estate agents and tenants in the UK. I worked at Goodlord during a period of high growth both commercially and internally. I joined when there were 6 engineers and helped scale the team to over 20 strong. During my time at Goodlord, I established a modern front-end tech stack consisting of React, TypeScript and a custom framework I authored specifically for Goodlord's complex form-management requirements called Helix.

As a designer/developer hybrid, I was heavily involved in the user-testing, ideation, feature discovery and delivery of several business-critical features.

**Commusoft** _Senior front-end engineer - March 2016 to November 2016_

Commusoft is a large customer relationship management system catered for the service industry. I led Commusoft's small front-end team for 8 months where I had a lead role in product and design as well as developing the front-end for the customer facing and internal products using a mixture of technologies such as Angular, React and Backbone. During this time, I also mentored junior front-end engineers and liaised with an off-shore back-end team. I was fortunate enough to implement modern software engineering / agile practises such as kanban, pair programming, code review and git-flow.

**Commusoft** _Junior front-end developer - July 2014 - March 2016_

I started my software engineering career at Commusoft where I quickly became autonomous under the direction of a senior front-end engineer. I was responsible for core feature development and design of a large CRM platform spanning multiple products. Towards the end of my position, I was single-handedly responsible for a customer facing product that I engineered using React and liaised with a remote backend team to see the product through to production.

## Open Source

I'm always developing my skills and often publish my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck) and [Npm](https://npmjs.com/~josephluck). I'm particularly proud of [Twine](https://github.com/josephluck/twine), an elm-inspired functional state management library and [Helix](https://github.com/josephluck/helix), a batteries included functional front-end framework providing state-management, routing and rendering with React.

## Personal Projects

During my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and improve my design and user experience skills. To this end, I enjoy building my own tools and products:

[Internote](https://internote.app/) is a distraction-free note editor built on top of a modern "serverless" stack consisting of TypeScript, React, Next, Styled Components and Twine on the front-end and TypeScript with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and a slew of other AWS services on the back-end.

[Keepies](https://github.com/josephluck/keepies) is a chrome extension that automatically takes screenshots of web apps at set intervals to aid front-end developers and designers curate their portfolio. Keepies is open-source and is written in TypeScript with React.

[Wtf.js](https://github.com/josephluck/wtf) (What The Forecast?!) is a terminal weather app written in TypeScript. It was written on a particularly cold winters weekend.

## Education

**Ravensbourne** _BA(hons) Sound Design - November 2011 - July 2014_

I achieved a first-class honours from Ravensbourne where I studied sound engineering, acoustics, synthesis and audio programming. For my final project, I built an audio game using a combination of C# and JavaScript in the Unity game engine. During my studies I became a freelance web designer whilst working for Three Men and a Camera as a freelance audio engineer shooting documentaries and promos for many of London's leading digital agencies.
