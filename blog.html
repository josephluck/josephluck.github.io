Both React and Styled Components work very well out of the box with Typescript. As a bonus, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code">Visual Studio Code</a> has fantastic built-in Typescript support.</p><h3 class="normal f4 lh-copy mv2 gray">Project set up</h3><p class="lh-copy mv3">Fantastec has several web products built on top of the same technology stack. As a result, we&#39;ve been able to share a fair amount of project boilerplate, configuration, UI components and utilities between projects.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3">To facilitate the sharing of code safely and easily, we&#39;re using <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/" title="Yarn Workspaces">Yarn Workspaces</a> to manage packages of code between products.</p><h3 class="normal f4 lh-copy mv2 gray">Communicating with the back-end</h3><p class="lh-copy mv3">One of the biggest sources of lost productivity I have seen in engineering teams is due to a poor contract between front-end and back-end engineers when it comes to HTTP communication. The problem is two-fold. First, API <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051182/what-is-data-transfer-object" title="data transfer objects">data transfer objects</a> are often agreed on informally (on slack, in the office etc) but are rarely enforced in the code leading to inconsistencies over time or <a href="https://medium.com/web-engineering-vox/the-art-of-defensive-programming-6789a9743ed4" title="defensive programming">defensive programming</a>. Second, front-end engineers are often blocked when they build a new feature, having to wait for the back-end team to finish the APIs that are required to power the feature.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3">At Fantastec, we&#39;ve attempted to tackle both of these issues with one approach: defining data transfer objects in Typescript on the front-end and transpiling them in to C# view models for the back-end to use. From these DTOs the front-end also creates a simple mock-server using a combination of <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server" title="JSON server">JSON server</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/" title="Faker">Faker</a>. The result is a fully autonomous front-end team that can finish features as if the real API exists.</p><h3 class="normal f4 lh-copy mv2 gray">Working with designers</h3><p class="lh-copy mv3">Working with designers is a topic that warrants it&#39;s own series of mini posts, however I wanted to share one particular aspect of the process that Fantastec has iterated upon: &quot;treat everything as a component&quot;. Designs are completed in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" title="Sketch">Sketch</a> and presented via <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com" title="Invision">Invision</a>. Front-end engineers pick up the designs and implement them using React and Styled Components inside a <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" title="Storybook">Storybook</a> in isolation from the main application. Once the components are finished, they are placed inside the application and tweaked with designers during a sign-off process.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3">The key point here is that we&#39;re building our UI components inside Storybook in isolation from the main application. The Storybook is published to a public URL for the purpose of documenting existing components when working on new interfaces.</p><h3 class="normal f4 lh-copy mv2 gray">Effective planning</h3><p class="lh-copy mv3">As with any productive team, planning is as important as execution and tooling.</p><p class="lh-copy mv3">Since I started Fantastec, the product team has grown four fold and continues to grow at a rapid pace. Consequently, we&#39;ve had to invest time in our process. We&#39;ve settled on two week &quot;focussed&quot; sprints where each sprint has a consistent theme. This helps everyone stay in the same context and encourages collaboration and pair-programming.</p>
