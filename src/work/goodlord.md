I worked at Goodlord between November 2016 and April 2018 in the core engineering team as a software engineer focussing on the front-end.

## Baby steps

Joining as the only front-end engineer with experience - very small team
Working in sprints, delivering a rebuild project
Initially vue.js, quickly introduced vuex

## Learning, building, learning, building

workat.goodlord.co built in two days pre-funding press release
Push to ramp up the team quickly, getting contractors in
Rethinking what we're building from a rewrite to a new product
Realignment on what technologies we used, move from vue to react with custom state management
Fully embracing functional programming using Typescript
Push to a component / design driven approach
New internal products, training other members in front-end and contributing to the front-end guild

## Dream team

Squads with cool names and work streams, introducing better team retrospectives, a focus on team-work
Delivery focussed, kanban and agile training
Measuring impact on features, working in iterations with care and thought - feeling like we achieved great velocity
Conducting user interviews, improving the quality of the platform's UI and UX - take away that this should be the de-facto standard everywhere no matter how early the product
First production client using the new system

## Let's get real

Restructure and refocus of the company post-series B funding failure
Product re-write was a bad idea, let's deliver value where our customers are
PHP monolith with jQuery, built with duct-tape (link to article about tech-debt from hn)
Explaining approach to working on adding to the platform safely
Plans for future stability of the front-end introducing React and component-driven design
Adding production error tracking using Sentry (omg the amount of errors)
Introducing metrics using Mixpanel
Improving the look and the feel of the platform, modernising it ready for new features

## Leaving on a high

Lessons learnt, friends made
