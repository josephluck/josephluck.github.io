##### josephreubenluck@gmail.com

I'm a software engineer with a profound interest in design, user experience and functional programming in languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. I'm also a passionate contributor to open source having published libraries through [GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~josephluck).

## Skills

I have commercial experience in a wide range of front-end tools and libraries. Whilst there are many to list, I am particularly experienced with functional programming in TypeScript using libraries such as React, Redux, Ramda and Jest. I also have experience with CoffeeScript, ES6/7 and NodeJS as well as other popular MVC libraries such as Vue, Angular and Backbone. Aside from my technical skills, I'm a keen visual and user-experience designer and I pride myself on being an excellent problem solver.

## Experience

**Fantastec Technology** _Front End Lead - April 2018 to Present_

Fantastec is a sports technology start-up dedicated to helping sports fans engage with their favourite sports, teams, and players. I lead Fantastec's front-end team and liaise with the wider product team and stakeholders to build several products. During Fanstastec's early stages I have a large part to play in the UI and UX of several products and I have been fortunate enough to establish several best practises such as style-guides, atomic design, functional / typesafe programming and component-based architecture. During my first month, I lead a migration away from a proprietary framework that severely hindered productivity to a modern stack consisting of Typescript, Styled Components, Next and React.

**Goodlord** _Software Engineer - November 2016 to April 2018_

Goodlord is a property technology company, primarily serving estate agents and tenants in the UK. I worked at Goodlord during a period of high growth both commercially and internally. I saw the core engineering team grow from a mere 6 to over 20 strong and during that period, I was involved and helped build features for several projects both customer-facing and internal. Whilst at Goodlord, I helped design and engineer a framework built around React called Helix and introduced the team to modern front-end techniques such as component-driven design and unidirectional data flow.

**Commusoft** _Senior front-end engineer - March 2016 to November 2016_

Commusoft is a large customer relationship management system catered for the service industry. I lead Commusoft's small front-end team for 8 months where I had a lead role in product and design as well as developing the front-end for the customer facing and internal products using a mixture of technologies such as Angular, React and Backbone. During this time, I also mentored a junior front-end engineer and implemented modern software engineering / agile practises such as kanban, pair programming, code review and git-flow.

**Commusoft** _Junior front-end developer - July 2014 - March 2016_

I started my software engineering career at Commusoft where I quickly became autonomous under the direction of a senior front-end engineer. I was responsible for core feature development and design of a large CRM platform spanning multiple products. Towards the end of my position, I was single-handedly responsible for a customer facing product that I engineered using React and liaised with a remote backend team to see the product through to production.

## Open Source

I'm always developing my skills and often publish my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck) and [Npm](https://npmjs.com/~josephluck). I'm particularly proud of [Twine](https://github.com/josephluck/twine), an elm-inspired functional state management library and [Helix](https://github.com/josephluck/helix), a batteries included functional front-end framework providing state-management, routing and rendering with React.

## Education

**Ravensbourne** _BA(hons) Sound Design - November 2011 - July 2014_

I achieved a first-class honours from Ravensbourne where I studied sound engineering, acoustics, synthesis and audio programming. For my final project, I built an audio game using a combination of C# and JavaScript in the Unity game engine. During my studies I became a freelance web designer whilst working for Three Men and a Camera as a freelance audio engineer shooting documentaries and promos for many of London's leading digital agencies.
